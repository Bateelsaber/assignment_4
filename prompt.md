# Assignment

This week's homework is to recreate a series of five small programs (challenges). For each challenge create a program that produces the same drawing, animation, or interaction.

[View the Challenges](http://pucd2035-e-f15.github.io/class_notes/week_3/challenges.html)


1. Create a fork of the Assignment 4 repository. Clone the repo to your computer.

2. The repo has a folder for each challenge. For each challenge try to reproduce the look and behavior as closely as possible.

3. Take a screen-grab of each of your programs' output and replace the screen grab in each folder. You don't need to edit the `README.md` this week.

4. Once you complete the five core challenges, you may want to attempt the bonus challenge. There is not a folder for the bonus challenge in the template repo, you will need to create one on your own. 

5. Sync your project in Github Desktop to publish your work to Github. Commit your work often, but **do not sync your work until Friday**. 

### Notes

- All of the challenges (even the bonus) can be completed with concepts covered in class so far, but you may use any javascript syntax you wish as well.

- Comment your code clearly. Use comments to create and annotate sections in your code.

- Write clear, well formatted code. 
 
- Use good, descriptive names for variables.

### Grading

You will receive 0.5 points for recreating the core technical aspect of each challenge in your code. An additional 0.25 points per challenge will be awarded for well written, well commented code. Partial credit will be awarded for partially completed challenges.
